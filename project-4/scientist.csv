At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. If you are someone motivated by meaningful work, Shift Technology may just be the spot for you! Your day-to-day At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too. Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems. The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis … As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available. Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve. After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to: Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms; Create the associated mathematical models; Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms; Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models; Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution. Your toolkit On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast! Your profile Shift Technology’s data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities. If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology: You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research; You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details; You can write quality production code; You don't mind frequent travel to meet with clients to discuss their needs and integrate their feedback in your projects; You can communicate clearly in English and are fluent in another language.Shift Technology - 30+ days ago - save job - report job - original jobApply NowApply On Company SiteSave this jobOther jobs you may likeData ScientistEyeotaSingaporeEyeota-30+ days agoData ScientistCOGNOPIA PTE.

With 18-member countries and 46 partner institutions, the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN) is a network of countries and partner institutions committed to elimination by 2030. APMEN is the country-led collaborative initiative for malaria elimination. With country programs front and centre, many members are world-renowned practitioners, and scientists who are highly motivated and committed to the 2030 elimination goal. APMEN is undergoing a process of change. An independent review of APMEN recently noted the network’s central role in supporting elimination across the region. It called for a significant scale up of activities, together with a reorientation, progressed in close consultation with the network membership to increase the impact of the initiative. The malaria elimination agenda is fast-moving, with unprecedented political support and momentum. APMEN is looking for a highly-motivated individual to work with the APMEN Secretariat to accelerate its initiatives in targeted research and capacity building for member countries in various fields (surveillance and response, vector control and program management quality improvement). Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA) The Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA) is an alliance of 23 Asian and Pacific heads of government formed to accelerate progress against malaria and to eliminate it in the region by 2030. APMEN has maintained a strong partnership with APLMA since 2013 to build momentum towards the 2030 regional malaria elimination goal. Their partnership strengthens the potential to accelerate elimination efforts by harnessing APMEN’s technical expertise, partnerships and engagement with national malaria control programmes, and linking this with the political advocacy and multisectoral access of APLMA. APLMA/APMEN Singapore Office The APLMA Secretariat is an independent organisation incorporated in Singapore. The APMEN Secretariat is co-located with APLMA. Both initiatives undertake a joint programme of work and coordinate their efforts to accelerate progress towards the 2030 goal. They aim to recognize and complement country efforts led by national governments as supported by the WHO. Both also acknowledge the large number of existing organizations working to reduce and eliminate malaria. Key responsibilities The Technical Officer will mainly work on the two following initiatives: 1. Multi-country study on outdoor malaria transmission The Technical officer will coordinate a multi-country study on outdoor malaria transmission. Residual malaria and outdoor transmission are currently the least understood and documented areas for vector control for malaria elimination. As countries in the Asia Pacific region scale up and intensify LLINs distribution and IRS, evidence-based guidelines are needed to manage the remaining malaria transmission and protect vulnerable and unguarded population. The Technical Officer will work hand-in-hand with the APMEN countries to progress the study. 2. Project Management Quality Improvement for National Malaria Program workforce APMEN identified the need for better training for the National Malaria Program in the areas of project management and quality improvement. To advocate for increased resources for training, APMEN plans to develop 3 case studies demonstrating the success of selected training initiatives. The Technical Officer will coordinate the development of these case studies, in collaboration with APMEN partner institutions. In addition to these two initiatives, the Technical Officer will support the APMEN Director and the APMEN Program Manager in several areas, including technical assistance to countries, monitoring & evaluating and communication. Requirements Essential qualifications A Master’s degree in any of the disciplines: international public health, biology, epidemiology or any related discipline; Excellent writing and oral communication skills in the English language; Proficiency in Microsoft Excel and/or Access for data management and analysis; and Able to do field work in tropical disease endemic communities.

This role sits amongst the leadership team of Xaxis APAC and is jointly responsible for growing revenue, driving analytics strategies and outputs, developing unique insights and analysis, and pushing Xaxis forward on their goal of being the leader in outcomes. Reporting of the role This role reports to the Senior Vice President of Xaxis APAC. 3 best things about the job: Direct and immediate impact to business Extraordinary growth and learning opportunities within APAC and beyond Highly visible position with clients, agencies, and other industry leaders Measures of success In three months: Complete understanding of team responsibilities, areas of focus, and engagement across regional and local teams You will have a firm understanding of where Xaxis “data” resides, it’s value, and be able to access it with ease In six months: You will become confident in your capabilities and be able to independently support regional and local markets on their requests and problems You will provide input to regional leadership on strategic direction and areas of potential growth & development for the team In 12 months: You will become a confident team leader and regional spokesperson for marketing science and insights & analytics to other regional leads You will provide strategic guidance and direction to our client strategy team as it pertains to marketing science and the responsibilities described in this job description Overview and Responsibilities of the role: The role of Director of Marketing Science will, put simply, ‘make data happen’ for Xaxis APAC – and is a key role given the growth of data-driven marketing, and the key opportunity for programmatic media in this space. The role will involve a combination of “building” our capabilities in the area of data, insights & analytics – to be applied across all countries, teams and clients in APAC – together with directly “executing” these capabilities across our key regional clients. As with data and it’s broad application across the business, the role will have the opportunity to work closely with a passionate and senior team of experts in programmatic advertising – experts in the areas of client strategy, supply, platforms and technology, product development and so on. While you will be data ‘smart’ and analytically-minded, you will become even more so, and you will inspire and guide others to do the same. You know a lot, but you don’t know everything, and you’re happy to admit it. You fill this gap through questions, seeking learning opportunities (formal and informal), and aligning with smart people. The Director of Marketing Science will play a critical role in supporting the success of Xaxis, by leading with a strategic, data-driven, and performance-focussed mind-set. ‘Strategic’ in the sense that you can generate different options, and make decisions that drive best long-term value for Xaxis. The pros and cons may not be obvious. The small things can make a big difference. The quickest solutions might not be the best. It might take many small steps to get the outcome we ultimately want. ‘Data-driven’, in that you use data for informing everyday decisions (internally), and apply widely to client and campaign solutions (externally). ‘Performance-focussed’ in that you know internal stakeholder, client and agency expectations, and you focus on delivering to these. And you know what makes sense, and what doesn’t, and how to influence. This role will have a broad remit to make best possible use of all available forms of data to improve campaign performance, increase profitability and revenue, and ultimately the value that Xaxis delivers to clients. Of course, the challenge is taking this data and turning it into meaningful insights that can be acted upon in a timely way. While formally sitting within the Marketing Science team, the role will have significant involvement across the business, in a truly cross-functional team, such as in the planning of new products, optimisation of campaign performance, ideas for new campaign outcomes, or the marketing of the value that Xaxis delivers. Specifically, these are the areas of Focus: Revenue Growth Measurement & Advanced Analytics Outcomes Custom Insights & Deep dives Team Management Revenue Growth: Engage in projects and initiatives with our regional client strategy team and local markets, where our analytical insights and guidance will yield in the increased spend by a client and or the shifting of budget from competitors to Xaxis advertising products: This will include, but not limited to: Ensuring clear campaign KPIs, and measurement (metrics and tracking) Strong Analytics Plans (including Brand Impact Studies, Attribution, etc) Strong Audience Plans (driven by Insights, as well as delivering new Insights) Significant application of data (audience and beyond) Driving consistency and quality across markets Benchmarking and quantifying the value of Xaxis to key stakeholders Measurement & Advanced Analytics: Produce advanced analytics and reports for clients that address direct and indirect business objectives, problems and decisions, yielding actionable insights that help drive improved campaign performance and or demonstrate measurable value. This will include, but not limited to: Attribution & Path to Conversion Analysis Brand Impact Studies Media Overlap Analysis Custom Deep Dive analyses for client pitches and annual reviews Custom Reporting and Tracking for key clients and campaigns Unique analytics strategies that align with client goals and objectives Outcomes: Guide your team of data scientists and data analysts to provide analytical support and guidance on the creation of custom algorithms for custom outcomes and provide the foundation and structure to enable local markets to derive benchmarks and estimates for outcome products This will include, but not limited to: Coordinate and guide discussions around key client custom algorithms Custom outcome tracking and reporting Custom Insights & Deep Dives: Create custom insights and research for top tier clients to assist in agency pitches, advanced PCA support, QBR, and annual reviews, by using 2nd party data, desk research, and other market research tools & methodologies This will include, but not limited to: Strong storytelling and compelling narratives Site traffic analytics and insights Economic trends Ad Server and 3rd party vendor verification analysis Team Leadership: Manage a team of 5 to 6 diverse marketing science team members including but not limited to: Guidance and direction on data science, insights, analytics, strategy, and stakeholder management Team unification, motivation, and strategic direction Collaboration with local market leads and regional leadership Training and the imparting of your skills and capabilities to them What you will need: A minimum of 10 years’ experience in analytics and digital advertising Team leadership experience with junior and senior team members To be comfortable and able to thrive in a fast paced and ever-changing environment Able to work in ambiguity and to stitch together a diversity of inputs and information Able to manage multiple deadlines and stakeholders and prioritize work for your team and others based on internal and external requirements Able & willing to speak comfortably and confidently with clients and customers Able to tell data stories and explain complex ideas in a simplified fashion Advanced skills in Excel, SQL, and business intelligence software (Tableau, Power BI, etc) About Xaxis Xaxis is a global digital media platform that programmatically connects advertisers to audiences across all addressable channels.

LTD.-SingaporePermanentRoles & Responsibilities Overview of job Xaxis APAC is seeking an experienced insights & analytics expert in the field of digital advertising to lead a team of talented data analysts and data scientists. This role sits amongst the leadership team of Xaxis APAC and is jointly responsible for growing revenue, driving analytics strategies and outputs, developing unique insights and analysis, and pushing Xaxis forward on their goal of being the leader in outcomes. Reporting of the role This role reports to the Senior Vice President of Xaxis APAC. 3 best things about the job: Direct and immediate impact to business Extraordinary growth and learning opportunities within APAC and beyond Highly visible position with clients, agencies, and other industry leaders Measures of success In three months: Complete understanding of team responsibilities, areas of focus, and engagement across regional and local teams You will have a firm understanding of where Xaxis “data” resides, it’s value, and be able to access it with ease In six months: You will become confident in your capabilities and be able to independently support regional and local markets on their requests and problems You will provide input to regional leadership on strategic direction and areas of potential growth & development for the team In 12 months: You will become a confident team leader and regional spokesperson for marketing science and insights & analytics to other regional leads You will provide strategic guidance and direction to our client strategy team as it pertains to marketing science and the responsibilities described in this job description Overview and Responsibilities of the role: The role of Director of Marketing Science will, put simply, ‘make data happen’ for Xaxis APAC – and is a key role given the growth of data-driven marketing, and the key opportunity for programmatic media in this space. The role will involve a combination of “building” our capabilities in the area of data, insights & analytics – to be applied across all countries, teams and clients in APAC – together with directly “executing” these capabilities across our key regional clients. As with data and it’s broad application across the business, the role will have the opportunity to work closely with a passionate and senior team of experts in programmatic advertising – experts in the areas of client strategy, supply, platforms and technology, product development and so on. While you will be data ‘smart’ and analytically-minded, you will become even more so, and you will inspire and guide others to do the same. You know a lot, but you don’t know everything, and you’re happy to admit it. You fill this gap through questions, seeking learning opportunities (formal and informal), and aligning with smart people. The Director of Marketing Science will play a critical role in supporting the success of Xaxis, by leading with a strategic, data-driven, and performance-focussed mind-set. ‘Strategic’ in the sense that you can generate different options, and make decisions that drive best long-term value for Xaxis. The pros and cons may not be obvious. The small things can make a big difference. The quickest solutions might not be the best. It might take many small steps to get the outcome we ultimately want. ‘Data-driven’, in that you use data for informing everyday decisions (internally), and apply widely to client and campaign solutions (externally). ‘Performance-focussed’ in that you know internal stakeholder, client and agency expectations, and you focus on delivering to these. And you know what makes sense, and what doesn’t, and how to influence. This role will have a broad remit to make best possible use of all available forms of data to improve campaign performance, increase profitability and revenue, and ultimately the value that Xaxis delivers to clients. Of course, the challenge is taking this data and turning it into meaningful insights that can be acted upon in a timely way.

At Shift Technology we are proud to have a purpose: to help insurers weed out claims corruption. Our SaaS solution, which leverages Big Data and AI, has been used to unravel fraud networks across Asia, Europe, and the Americas. If you are someone motivated by meaningful work, Shift Technology may just be the spot for you! Your day-to-day At Shift Technology, we are constantly looking for new ways to innovate. Fraud landscapes are in constant motion and in order to ensure our detection methods are always one step ahead, our data scientists must be too. Shift Technology data scientists are the central productive force of the company. They design the models, construct the features, implement the rules, and optimize the algorithms that are used throughout the data processing pipeline. They face two main challenges: messy and often incomplete data paired with complex and ever-evolving problems. The data we collect comes in all shapes and sizes and is not, for the most part, quantitative. Insurance claims data typically includes date, location, circumstantial details, damage descriptions, and involved parties. With that wide array of information, our data scientists must be comfortable with a variety of specific approaches: unsupervised anomaly detection, temporal sequences analysis, semantic network analysis … As for the solution, our data scientists must be able to produce predictions justified with intelligible explanations, even when very little data is available. Our data scientists have the exciting mission of designing and implementing models that replicate and enhance real-world fraud handling deduction patterns. They are tasked with optimizing the algorithms involved in the data processing pipeline and making adjustments as fraud scenarios mature and evolve. After a few short months of joining our data scientist team you will be able to: Understand insurance data and fraud mechanisms; Create the associated mathematical models; Implement, test and optimize the associated algorithms; Participate in workshops with the clients to gather feedback and integrate it to the models; Continuously provide ideas to improve the solution. Your toolkit On the job you will be asked to code in C# so programming experience is a big advantage, but not essential if you are willing to learn fast! Your profile Shift Technology’s data science department is filled with top performers who are committed to technical excellence, inspired by challenging projects, and always on the look-out for new learning opportunities. If the following qualities ring true, you would fit right in at Shift Technology: You have advanced technical skills in Applied Mathematics, preferably in machine learning and/or operations research; You combine strong analysis with synthesis abilities and are not afraid to deal with the details; You can write quality production code; You don't mind frequent travel to meet with clients to discuss their needs and integrate their feedback in your projects; You can communicate clearly in English and are fluent in another language.Shift Technology - 30+ days ago - save job - report job - original jobApply NowApply On Company SiteSave this jobOther jobs you may likeData ScientistEyeotaSingaporeEyeota-30+ days agoData ScientistCOGNOPIA PTE.
